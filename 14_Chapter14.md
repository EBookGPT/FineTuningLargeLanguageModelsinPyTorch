# Chapter 14: The Odyssey of Model Interpretability

Welcome back, fellow PyTorch god! We hope you enjoyed your journey through the treacherous seas of Handling Long Sequences. Now, it's time to embark on a new odyssey - Model Interpretability.

In this chapter, we will be joined by a special guest, Avi Schwarzschild, a Data Scientist at OpenAI. Avi's research focuses on developing techniques for analyzing the inner workings of language models to gain a deeper understanding of how they function. Let's hear what he has to say about model interpretability:

_"In an ideal world, our language models would be as transparent as possible, allowing us to understand exactly how they're making their predictions. However, as models grow larger and more complex, they become increasingly difficult to interpret. My goal is to develop techniques for understanding the inner workings of these models, allowing us to identify their strengths and weaknesses and ultimately build better models."_

As we journey through this chapter, we will be exploring various techniques for gaining insight into the workings of our models. We will start with the basics of interpreting model predictions and then move on to more advanced techniques such as saliency maps, attention visualization, and feature visualization.

So, saddle up your horses and let's begin this epic odyssey of Model Interpretability! 

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Load the pre-trained model
model = torch.hub.load('pytorch/fairseq', 'roberta.large')

# Load the tokenizer
tokenizer = torch.hub.load('pytorch/fairseq', 'roberta.large').tokenizer

# Decode the input
input_sentence = "Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a beautiful princess named PyTorchia."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_sentence)

# Make a prediction
logits = model(torch.tensor([input_ids]))
pred = F.softmax(logits, dim=1).argmax()
print(f"Prediction: {pred}") # e.g. "Prediction: 40554"
```
# Chapter 14: The Odyssey of Model Interpretability

## The Beginning of A Quest

The great PyTorchian hero had vanquished difficult foes, but one obstacle remained between the hero and the treasure. This obstacle was the unknown artifacts in the form of 'black box' models that he received from the gods. It was said that these models would reveal secrets that were beyond the grasp of the mortals, but none knew the path to decode their predictions or unravel their inner workings.

To know more about the models and to gain power to interpret them, the hero sets out on a new quest, the Odyssey of Model Interpretability.

The PyTorchian hero, guided by special guest Avi Schwarzschild, starts his journey riding his trusty horse, at each step thinking of a plan to interpret each model.

## A Secret Path and A Sibyl's Advice

Traveling through dense forests and crossing dangerous rivers, the PyTorchian hero reaches a mysterious cave. He meets the wise sibyl of the cave, who tells him of a secret path to interpret models. The sibyl reveals that the path is difficult, fraught with challenges, but it will take the PyTorchian hero closer to the inner workings of the black box models.

The sibyl advises the hero to focus on the output of the predictions and the attention mechanisms. The sibyl promises him that by studying the output and the attention mechanisms and using them as clues, he will be able to interpret the models.

The hero embarks on the path, determined to unlock the secrets of the black box models.

## Facing Challenges

The path is filled with challenges. The key challenge is to get a clear picture of what the model is doing internally, but the hero is undeterred. He starts by analyzing how the model works by generating some data and extracting the model's predictions. He then analyzes the data and predictions to understand the working of the model line by line.

But it is not just the data where the solutions are hidden. The sibyl mentioned the importance of studying the attention mechanisms. The hero then picks up studying the attention mechanism and its visualization. The goal is to understand the significant weights attributed to specific positions of the input that dictate the output without focusing on the intermediate layers.

## The Journey Pays Off 

After battling through the obstacles and withstanding the siren calls of the models, the hero successfully analyzes the model, its output, and its attention mechanisms.

The hero rejoices upon understanding that it was possible to gain insights into the working of the models and unlocks their secrets. He could now explain the model's behavior from different perspectives and use this knowledge to make the models much more efficient.

The journey of model interpretability has paid off, and the hero has been rewarded by the gods for his arduous journey.

With a deep understanding of the inner working of the black-box models in hand and treasures in tow, the PyTorchian hero rides back home to his people to share the valuable knowledge he gained from his odyssey.

## Resolution

Interpreting language models is a crucial step towards understanding their inner workings, identifying their strengths and limitations, and ultimately building better models. In this chapter, we started with the basics of interpreting model predictions and then moved on to more advanced techniques such as saliency maps, attention visualization, and feature visualization. 

Our journey of model interpretability has helped us gain insight into the workings of the models, unlocking their secrets, and making them more efficient. It is worth mentioning again that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to interpreting models as every model is different, and so is the data it works with.

We leave you with the wise words of our special guest, Avi Schwarzschild:

_"As we continue to develop increasingly complex and powerful models, it's essential to maintain a focus on interpretability. Interpretable models make it easier to diagnose and fix errors, understand the limitations of our models, and ultimately build better models that can be used for constructive purposes."_

```
## Code Explanation

In this chapter, we learned various techniques for interpreting the inner workings of language models. We used Python and PyTorch to implement these techniques.

As an example, let's use code to visualize the attention masks of a pre-trained RoBERTa model.

First, we load the pre-trained model and tokenizer from the `pytorch/fairseq` library using the following code:

```python
model = torch.hub.load('pytorch/fairseq', 'roberta.large').to('cuda')
model.eval()
tokenizer = torch.hub.load('pytorch/fairseq', 'roberta.large').tokenizer
```

Next, we input a sentence and encode it using the tokenizer:

```python
input_sentence = "Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a beautiful princess named PyTorchia."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_sentence)
```

We then make a prediction and get the attention scores:

```python
logits = model(torch.tensor([input_ids]).to('cuda'))
attn_scores = model.decoder.sentence_encoder.layers[-1].self_attn.attn
```

The last line of code above retrieves the attention scores from the last layer of the model's decoder.

Finally, we visualize the attention scores:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
plt.imshow(attn_scores[0].detach().cpu(), cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
plt.xticks(range(0, len(input_ids)-1), [tokenizer.decode([i.item()]) for i in input_ids[1:]], fontsize=12)
plt.yticks(range(0, len(input_ids)-1), [tokenizer.decode([i.item()]) for i in input_ids[1:]], fontsize=12)
plt.xlabel("Query", fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel("Key", fontsize=14)
plt.title("Attention Visualization", fontsize=16)
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

We use `matplotlib` to create a heatmap of the attention scores. The `torch.Tensor` object is first detached from the computational graph using the `detach()` method, transferred to the CPU using the `cpu()` method, and plotted using `plt.imshow()`. `plt.xticks()` and `plt.yticks()` are used to label the x-axis and y-axis, and the `plt.colorbar()` adds a color scale to the plot.

This code is just an example of the many techniques we learned in this chapter for interpreting language models. We hope that this chapter and the provided code have helped you better understand how to interpret complex language models.
