# Chapter 15: Deploying Fine-Tuned Large Language Models

Congratulations on making it this far! In the previous chapter, we explored the importance of model interpretability and how we can make sense of the inner workings of a fine-tuned large language model. Now, we embark on the final chapter of our journey - deployment.

At this point, you have invested a significant amount of time and effort in fine-tuning your model to achieve state-of-the-art results on your downstream tasks. However, the true value of the model lies in its ability to be used in real-world applications. Deployment is where the rubber hits the road - it's where your model translates from an experimental prototype to a reliable, production-ready tool.

In this chapter, we will explore the various ways in which we can deploy our fine-tuned models, including:

1. Local inference on a single machine or device
2. Deployment to a cloud environment
3. Deployment to mobile devices
4. Deployment through containerization

We will also cover the advantages and disadvantages of each method, as well as any potential pitfalls that you may encounter. As always, we will provide code snippets to help guide you through the process of deployment.

So, fasten your seatbelt and get ready to take your fine-tuned model to the final level. Let's deploy!
# Chapter 15: Deploying Fine-Tuned Large Language Models - The Wizard of Oz Parable

Once upon a time, there was a young data scientist named Dorothy who had spent months fine-tuning a large language model in PyTorch. She had finally achieved impressive results on her downstream tasks and was eager to deploy her model to the real world. 

"Dorothy," said her mentor, Professor Oz, "you have climbed the mountain of fine-tuning, and now it is time to cross the valley of deployment. There are many paths you can take, but each has its own set of challenges. You must choose the right path wisely."

Dorothy frowned. She had poured her heart and soul into fine-tuning her model, and the idea of tackling yet another obstacle was daunting.

"Don't worry, my dear," said Professor Oz, sensing her hesitation. "I will help guide you. The path of deployment can be treacherous, but with determination and the right tools, you will emerge victorious."

Together, Dorothy and Professor Oz set out on their journey to deploy the fine-tuned model. As they walked, Professor Oz explained the different methods of deployment and their advantages and disadvantages.

"Local inference on a single machine or device is a great option if you need low latency and privacy. But if you expect high traffic, you should consider a cloud environment," advised Professor Oz. "And if you plan to deploy on mobile devices, you need to take into account resource constraints and different operating systems."

Dorothy listened intently, and as they walked, she began to understand the importance of choosing the right deployment method. Eventually, they arrived at a crossroad, where several paths lay before them.

"Dorothy, this is where we part ways," said Professor Oz. "Choose the path that you believe is best, and remember, no matter what challenges lie ahead, you have the skills and knowledge to overcome them."

With newfound confidence, Dorothy chose the path that she believed was best for her model. She encountered some challenges along the way, but with Professor Oz's guidance and the code snippets she had learned, she was able to successfully deploy her model.

The Wizard of Oz's wisdom had proven true once again - with the right determination, skills, and guidance, Dorothy had successfully crossed the valley of deployment and emerged victorious, ready to make an impact in the real world.
The code used to deploy fine-tuned large language models can vary depending on the deployment method. In this chapter, we will provide code snippets to help guide you through the process of deployment for the following methods:

## Local Inference
Local inference on a single machine or device is a great option if you need low latency and privacy. In order to deploy a fine-tuned model locally, you can use the following code for inference:

```python
import torch

# Load the fine-tuned model
model = torch.load('fine_tuned_model.pt')

# Set the device for inference (CPU by default)
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model.to(device)

# Prepare the input data
input_data = 'input sentence'
input_tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(input_data)
input_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(input_tokens)

# Perform inference
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model(torch.tensor(input_ids).unsqueeze(0).to(device))
```

## Cloud Environment
If you expect high traffic, you should consider a cloud environment. A popular cloud platform for deploying PyTorch models is AWS Lambda. Here's an example code snippet for deploying a fine-tuned model using AWS Lambda and API Gateway:

```python
import boto3

# Load the fine-tuned model
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.download_file('your-bucket-name', 'fine_tuned_model.pt', 'fine_tuned_model.pt')
model = torch.load('fine_tuned_model.pt')

# Define the function handler
def handler(event, context):
    # Prepare the input data
    input_data = event['input']
    input_tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(input_data)
    input_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(input_tokens)

    # Perform inference
    with torch.no_grad():
        predictions = model(torch.tensor(input_ids).unsqueeze(0).to('cpu'))

    # Return the results
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': predictions.tolist()[0]
    }
```

## Mobile Devices
If you plan to deploy on mobile devices, you need to take into account resource constraints and different operating systems. A popular toolkit for deploying PyTorch models on mobile devices is PyTorch Mobile. Here's an example code snippet for deploying a fine-tuned model using PyTorch Mobile:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Load the fine-tuned model
model = torch.load('fine_tuned_model.pt')

# Define the model class
class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.model = model

    def forward(self, input_data):
        input_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(input_data)
        predictions = self.model(torch.tensor(input_ids).unsqueeze(0))
        return F.softmax(predictions, dim=1)

# Export the model to a mobile format
example_input = torch.randn(1, sequence_length, input_size)
traced_model = torch.jit.trace(Model().eval(), example_input)
traced_model._c._jit_write_code('model.cpp')

# Compile the model for mobile devices
cd /path/to/android/project/
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

## Containerization
Finally, if you want to deploy your fine-tuned model as a container, you can use Docker. Here's an example Dockerfile for containerizing a PyTorch model:

```Dockerfile
FROM pytorch/pytorch:1.9.0-cuda11.1-cudnn8-runtime

# Install any additional dependencies
RUN pip install pandas

# Copy the model into the container
COPY fine_tuned_model.pt /app/

# Define the script to run on startup
COPY main.py /app/
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

These code snippets serve only as examples, and depending on your specific use case, you may need to modify them. However, they should be helpful in guiding you through the process of deploying your fine-tuned model.
