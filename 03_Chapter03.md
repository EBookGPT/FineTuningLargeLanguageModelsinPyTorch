# Chapter 3: Preprocessing Data for Large Language Models

Welcome back, dear reader! In the previous chapter, we delved into the world of PyTorch and learned about its basic functionality. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into understanding how to preprocess the data for our large language models.

Preparing data for large language models is crucial as it sets the foundation for the model's performance. As Abigail See, a research scientist at OpenAI, puts it, "Preprocessing is where the magic happens."

Preprocessing data for large language models involves various steps. We will look into each of these steps in detail throughout this chapter.

Some of the preprocessing tasks we will cover include:
- Tokenization
- Vocabulary building
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Dataset creation 

We will also explore best practices to follow when preprocessing data, as well as common errors to avoid.

# Chapter 3: Preprocessing Data for Large Language Models

Welcome back, dear reader! In the previous chapter, we delved into the world of PyTorch and learned about its basic functionality. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into understanding how to preprocess the data for our large language models.

Preparing data for large language models is crucial as it sets the foundation for the model's performance. As Abigail See, a research scientist at OpenAI, puts it, "Preprocessing is where the magic happens."

Miss Abigail See was walking into her laboratory when she heard a loud commotion. Upon entering her workspace, she saw that her team was frantically trying to debug a language model. She found out that the cause of the issue was related to preprocessing of the data. 

Miss See knew that the key to a strong language model lies in the quality of its data preprocessing. Hence, she immediately called upon Sherlock Holmes to investigate this peculiar case.

Sherlock Holmes arrived at the lab, inspecting the code critically. Holmes found that the tokenization step was not done correctly. No additional token was added at the beginning or end of the text to indicate the start or end of a sequence.

Holmes explained to the team that tokenization was the process of dividing the text into individual units or tokens. Text consists of a combination of alphabets, symbols, and punctuation, which cannot be analyzed by neural networks. Hence, tokenization was required to transform the input text into a format that the network could process. 

Next, Holmes investigated the vocabulary building step. He observed that the dataset included a vast number of words, including spelling mistakes and rare words that were not included in the vocabulary. Holmes explained to the team that vocabulary building was a crucial step in language modeling, as the vocabulary size determines the model's memory usage and speed.

"The vocabulary should only include the most frequent words and exclude any rare or misspelled ones. This is achievable by using a frequency cutoff. Words that are infrequent should be replaced by a special `UNK` token which represents unknown words," said Holmes.

Holmes also advised the team to clean the data before building the vocabulary. This would involve removing any unnecessary characters, such as punctuations and digits, from the text. Additionally, the dataset should be formatted in a way that could be easily read by the language model.

Holmes knew that the team needed guidance in dataset creation, so he shared his knowledge on the subject. He explained that creating datasets for training large language models was crucial for their success.

"You should ensure that the dataset follows the structure expected by the model, such as transforms, transforms that included tokenization, and batching," he said.

With Holmes' guidance, the team fixed the tokenization, vocabulary building, and data cleaning steps - the preprocessing phase. The language model was soon rapidly generating coherent sentences, adding a touch of magic to the research.

In conclusion, data preprocessing is fundamental to the quality of the model. Tokenization, vocabulary building, data cleaning, formatting, and dataset creation are the different steps involved in preprocessing. Follow these steps correctly, including best practices and common pitfalls to avoid, to enhance your model's performance.

In the Sherlock Holmes mystery, we observed that the preprocessing steps were not done correctly, causing errors in the language model. Let's now take a look at the code used to resolve these errors:

**Tokenization**

```
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-multilingual-cased', do_lower_case=False)
```

In the above code, we use the BertTokenizer class from the transformer module to tokenize our input text. We use the `from_pretrained()` method to retrieve a pre-trained tokenizer, in this case, `bert-base-multilingual-cased`. This tokenizer is pre-trained on a large corpus of text, ensuring that it can handle most text inputs.

```
# adding special [CLS] and [SEP] tokens
# used to indicate start and end of sequence

input_ids = []
attention_masks = []

for text in texts:
    encoded_dict = tokenizer.encode_plus(text, add_special_tokens=True, max_length=256, 
                                          pad_to_max_length=True, return_attention_mask=True)
    input_ids.append(encoded_dict['input_ids'])
    attention_masks.append(encoded_dict['attention_mask'])
```

In the above code, we add the special `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens to indicate the start and end of the sequence. These tokens are added using the `add_special_tokens=True` argument in the `encode_plus()` method. We also set the maximum sequence length to 256 using `max_length=256`. Text inputs that exceed this length are truncated, and those under this length are padded with zeros to ensure the same length across different inputs. The encoded input and attention masks are then stored in the `input_ids` and `attention_masks` lists.

**Vocabulary building**

```
from collections import Counter

# combine all texts into a single string
all_text = ' '.join(texts)
# remove unnecessary characters, such as symbols and punctuations
all_text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]','', all_text)

# use Counter to count word frequencies
word_freq = Counter(all_text.split())

# create the vocabulary by filtering out words that occur less than a given frequency
vocab = [word for word in word_freq if word_freq[word] > freq_cutoff]
```

In the above code, the vocabulary building step is done using the `Counter()` class from the Python `collections` module. We combine all the input texts into a single string and remove any unnecessary characters, such as symbols and punctuations. We then use `Counter()` to count the frequency of each word in the text. We filter out words that occur less than a given frequency by setting a frequency cut-off. Words that occur less than this frequency are replaced by a special `UNK` token. The final vocabulary is stored in the `vocab` list.

**Data cleaning and formatting**

```
def clean_text(text):
    """
    Removes unnecessary characters, such as symbols and line breaks, from the input text.
    """
    text = text.lower()
    
    # replace symbols and line breaks with spaces
    text = re.sub(r'[\n\t]', ' ', text)
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]','', text)
    
    # remove multiple spaces
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    text = text.strip()
    
    return text
```

In the above code, we define a `clean_text()` function that removes any unnecessary characters, such as symbols and line breaks, from the input text. We convert the text to lowercase and replace symbols and line breaks with spaces using the `re.sub()` method. We also remove any multiple spaces in the text and trim the text using the `strip()` method.

**Dataset Creation**

```
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, random_split
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, RandomSampler, SequentialSampler

# combine input_ids and attention_masks into a single dataset
dataset = TensorDataset(torch.tensor(input_ids), torch.tensor(attention_masks), torch.tensor(labels))

# split the dataset into training and validation datasets
train_size = int(0.9 * len(dataset))
val_size = len(dataset) - train_size
train_dataset, val_dataset = random_split(dataset, [train_size, val_size])

# create data loaders for training and validation datasets
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, sampler=RandomSampler(train_dataset), batch_size=batch_size)
val_dataloader = DataLoader(val_dataset, sampler=SequentialSampler(val_dataset), batch_size=batch_size)
```

In the above code, we combine the `input_ids`, `attention_masks`, and `labels` into a single dataset using the `TensorDataset()` class from the PyTorch `utils.data` module. We use the `random_split()` method to split the dataset into training and validation datasets. We then create data loaders for these datasets using the `DataLoader()` class. The `RandomSampler()` and `SequentialSampler()` methods are used to sample data from the training and validation datasets, respectively. The `batch_size` parameter sets the number of input texts processed per batch.

And that's it! By following these preprocessing steps, we can ensure that our language model performs optimally.
