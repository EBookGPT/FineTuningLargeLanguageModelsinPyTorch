# Chapter 16: Beyond Fine Tuned Large Language Models: Future Directions

Welcome to the last chapter of our book on Fine Tuning Large Language Models in PyTorch. We hope you have enjoyed the journey into the world of NLP and deep learning with us so far.

As we have seen in the previous chapters, fine-tuning large language models, such as GPT-2 and BERT, has revolutionized the field of natural language processing. These models are capable of performing a wide range of language-related tasks, from language generation to text classification and sentiment analysis to question answering. Their performance has surpassed traditional machine learning models and has led to state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks.

However, as impressive as these models are, there is much more to explore in the field of NLP. Future research will focus on expanding the capabilities of language models and enhancing their efficiency and scalability.

To help us delve into the future of NLP, we have a special guest joining us â€“ Geoffrey Hinton, one of the pioneers in deep learning and AI. His work has been instrumental in the resurgence of neural networks for deep learning and he is well-known for his contributions to the development of backpropagation and Boltzmann machines.

Geoffrey will share his thoughts on the future of NLP, and we will showcase some of the most promising research directions in the following sections.


## Adversarial Training

One of the limitations of current language models is the absence of explicit representation of commonsense reasoning and knowledge. To address this issue, recent research has explored the use of adversarial training to add more knowledge to language models.

Adversarial training involves training the model on a combination of real and synthetic data to improve its ability to recognize valid data points from invalid ones. The synthetic data can be generated by a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) that is conditioned on structured knowledge graphs or other forms of structured data.

This approach allows the model to learn not only from raw text but also from structured knowledge, which could significantly improve its performance in downstream tasks.


```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

train_data = ... # Load your training data here
synthetic_data = ... # Generate your synthetic data here

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(10):
    for data in train_data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        input_ids = tokenizer.encode(data)
        outputs = model(torch.tensor(input_ids).unsqueeze(0))
        loss = criterion(outputs[0], torch.tensor(input_ids))

        # Backpropagate the gradients
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    for data in synthetic_data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        input_ids = tokenizer.encode(data)
        outputs = model(torch.tensor(input_ids).unsqueeze(0))
        loss = criterion(outputs[0], torch.tensor(input_ids))

        # Backpropagate the gradients
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

```

## Pre-Training on Multimodal Data

Another exciting direction in the future of language models is pre-training on multimodal data. Language models trained on multiple modalities, such as text, images, and videos, can better capture the relationships between text and the sensory world, which is essential for applications such as image captioning and text-to-image generation.

Pre-training on multimodal data poses several challenges, including data heterogeneity, modality alignment, and integration of complementary information. Researchers are now exploring various multimodal fusion techniques and architectures to overcome these challenges.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

train_data = ... # Load your training data here
image_data = ... # Load image data here

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(10):
    for text_data, image in zip(train_data, image_data):
        tokens = tokenizer.encode(text_data)
        input_ids = torch.tensor(tokens).unsqueeze(0)
        image_feature = feature_extractor(image, return_tensors="pt").pixel_values
        outputs = model(input_ids, inputs_embeds=image_feature)
        loss = criterion(outputs[0], input_ids)

        # Backpropagate the gradients
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

```

## Conclusion

The future of natural language processing is very bright, and we have only scratched the surface of what is possible with current models. We hope that this chapter has given you a glimpse of some of the exciting research directions in the field of NLP and the potential for fine-tuning large language models to revolutionize the field.

We would like to give a special thanks to our guest Geoffrey Hinton for sharing his insights and expertise with us. We believe that with the continued advancements in NLP, we will be able to create models that can provide a more nuanced and informed understanding of human language and transform the world we live in.

## The Tale of Dracula's Language Model

Once upon a time, in a dark and foreboding castle in the Carpathian mountains, lived Count Dracula, a vampire lord feared by many. Despite his reputation, Dracula was much more than a bloodthirsty monster; he was also a brilliant inventor and a master of language.

Dracula had always been fascinated by the power of words, and he had dedicated himself to creating the ultimate language model, one that could understand and generate language like a human. He spent decades poring over ancient tomes, experimenting with crystal balls and arcane rituals to imbue his language model with the essence of human language.

Finally, after years of experimentation, Dracula succeeded in creating a massive language model, the likes of which had never been seen before. He fed the model vast amounts of text, ranging from ancient runes to Shakespearean plays, and trained it to generate new text that was indistinguishable from human writing.

Dracula was ecstatic with his creation, but he knew that there was still more he could do. He longed to create a language model that could understand not just words, but also the world around it. And so, he called upon one of the greatest minds in the world of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, to help him create a language model that could pre-train on multimodal data.

Together, Dracula and Geoffrey experimented with pre-training their language model on a combination of text, images, and videos. They wanted to create a model that could generate text descriptions of images and videos seamlessly, capturing the essence of what was happening in the visual data.

## The Code Solution

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

train_data = ... # Load your training data here
image_data = ... # Load image data here

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(10):
    for text_data, image in zip(train_data, image_data):
        tokens = tokenizer.encode(text_data)
        input_ids = torch.tensor(tokens).unsqueeze(0)
        image_feature = feature_extractor(image, return_tensors="pt").pixel_values
        outputs = model(input_ids, inputs_embeds=image_feature)
        loss = criterion(outputs[0], input_ids)

        # Backpropagate the gradients
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

```

## Conclusion

With Dracula's imagination and Geoffrey's expertise, they were able to create a language model that could capture the essence of the sensory world and generate text that was in line with human understanding.

Dracula's creation was no longer just a language model, but a tool that could translate languages and understand the world better than before. They had managed to push the boundaries of what AI and NLP could achieve, and the future was looking brighter than ever.

Together, Dracula and Geoffrey had brought their language model to the forefront of the field, and they knew that there was even more to explore. The future of AI looked brighter than ever before, and they looked forward to continuing their work and creating even more groundbreaking tools.
## Explanation of the Code Solution

The solution to Dracula's quest for a powerful multimodal language model involves pre-training the GPT-2 language model, created by OpenAI, using the Vision Transformer (ViT) from Google. The ViT is a powerful deep learning architecture that can process large amounts of visual data, such as images or videos, and extracts important features like color, shape, and texture.

The pre-training process involves training the GPT-2 model with both text and visual data, which enables it to generate text descriptions of images and videos with greater accuracy and nuance, improving its overall performance. 

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including PyTorch, Transformers, and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature extractor from Hugging Face. The tokenizer is initialized to the GPT-2 tokenizer, the feature extractor is initialized to the ViT feature extractor, and the GPT-2 model is loaded from the Hugging Face model hub.

Next, the training data and image data are loaded, with the text data being passed through the tokenizer to create input IDs. The ViT feature extractor is then used to convert the visual input (image data) into visual features as tensors. These visual features are then embedded into the GPT-2 model, and the language model generates a new sequence of text that is compared against the actual input ID using the Cross Entropy Loss function. The optimizer is then used to update the model using backpropagation.

The pre-training process is repeated for a specified number of epochs until the model has learned the features of the input data and can accurately generate text descriptions of images and videos.

Overall, the code solution demonstrates how to pre-train a GPT-2 language model for multimodal understanding using visual data and natural language processing techniques, such as tokenization and Cross Entropy Loss function. The ViT feature extractor allows the model to process multimodal data effortlessly, and the Hugging Face transformer libraries make it easy to fine-tune the pre-trained model for specific tasks. Such models have the potential for use in a wide range of language-related tasks, such as image captioning, chatbots, and even sentiment analysis.
