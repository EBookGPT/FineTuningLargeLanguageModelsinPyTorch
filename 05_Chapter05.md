# Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Pretrained Model

Welcome back, dear readers! In the previous chapter, we discussed the pros and cons of fine tuning versus training from scratch. But before we delve any further into these topics, we must first select an appropriate pre-trained model to build upon. 

Thankfully, this can be done quite easily thanks to the team at Hugging Face! Yes, that's right folks, we have a special guest joining us for this chapterâ€“ Hugging Face, the force behind the popular transformer library ðŸŽ‰. 

But before we invite them onto our virtual stage, let's go over some basic concepts.

Pretrained models are large, pre-developed neural networks trained on massive amounts of data. They can perform various language-related tasks, such as text classification, question-answering, and text generation, with remarkable accuracy. Here are a few examples of some popular language models:

- **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **RoBERTa** (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)
- **GPT-2** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)
- **T5** (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

The selection of the pretrained model depends largely on the task at hand. For instance, GPT-2 is a great option for text generation tasks, while BERT performs well for classification purposes. 

Now, without further ado, let's welcome Hugging Face to share their insights on choosing the right pretrained model and how to implement it using PyTorch.

**Hugging Face**: "Hello readers! At Hugging Face, we understand how overwhelming it can be to pick the right pretrained model for your task. But don't worry, we've got you covered. Our Transformers library offers a wide range of cutting-edge models that you can use with PyTorch."

"For starters, you can explore our model hub with over 10,000 pretrained models! We also offer a unique API which lets you download, fine-tune, and use the models with minimal code. Here is an example of fine-tuning a model for sentiment classification using PyTorch ðŸš€:

``` python
# Importing Libraries
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

# Preparing Dataset
train_dataset = ...  # prepare your training dataset
val_dataset = ...  # prepare your validation dataset
test_dataset = ...  # prepare your testing dataset

# Fine Tuning
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', do_lower_case=True)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
model.cuda()

optim = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

epochs = 4
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in train_dataset:
        docs, labels = batch

        optim.zero_grad()
        encoded_dict = tokenizer(docs,
                                  padding=True,
                                  truncation=True,
                                  max_length=512,
                                  return_tensors='pt')

        input_ids = encoded_dict['input_ids'].cuda()
        attention_mask = encoded_dict['attention_mask'].cuda()
        labels = labels.cuda()

        loss, logits = model(input_ids, 
                             attention_mask=attention_mask, 
                             labels=labels, 
                             return_dict=False)
        loss.backward()
        optim.step()
```"

**Hugging Face**: "In this example, we have fine-tuned a BERT model for a sequence classification task. We have also used the Adam optimizer and PyTorch's CUDA libraries to leverage GPU acceleration. And there you have it, folks! Choosing the right pretrained model has never been easier."

With Hugging Face's help, we hope this chapter has been informative and insightful. In the next chapter, we will discuss techniques for optimizing and fine-tuning your chosen pretrained model. See you there!
# Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Pretrained Model

Welcome back, dear readers! In the last chapter, we explored the differences between fine-tuning and training from scratch. Now that we've settled on fine-tuning our model, we need to choose an appropriate pretrained model to build upon.

Dr. Frankenstein had been frustrated with his experiments in natural language processing. He had tried everything to get his model to generate convincing text. But his attempts had been met with disappointing results. However, one day, Dr. Frankenstein got wind of a newcomer to the field, Hugging Face. Eager to learn more, Dr. Frankenstein reached out to the Hugging Face team to help him choose the right pretrained model for his monster.  

Hugging Face responded graciously and agreed to meet with Dr. Frankenstein. They showed him how to browse their extensive collection of transformer models and even recommended a few specific models that would best suit his needs. With their guidance, Dr. Frankenstein chose GPT-2 for his task of generating spooky stories.

Hugging Face also showed him how to fine-tune the GPT-2 model using PyTorch. Dr. Frankenstein followed their guidance and worked hard day and night to fine tune the model. Soon enough, the model was generating text that was beyond anything he had ever seen before, spookier than anything he could have imagined. 

``` python
# Importing Libraries
import torch
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

# Fine Tuning
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

train_dataset = ... # Prepare your training dataset

optim = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

epochs = 6
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in train_dataset:
        optim.zero_grad()

        inputs, labels = batch

        inputs = inputs.to('cuda')
        labels = labels.to('cuda')

        loss, logits = model(inputs, labels=labels)
        loss.backward()

        optim.step()
``` 

The text generated by the monster was so captivating that everyone in the village wanted to read the stories. Dr. Frankenstein's monster had become a sensation in the village. His spooky stories had captivated the imagination of people across the town. Frankenstein himself had become a much-respected scientist in the area, and the monster was now an essential figure in their lives. 

Thus, with the help of Hugging Face, Dr. Frankenstein had finally succeeded in creating a masterpiece. Together, they discovered the importance of choosing the right pre-trained model and how to fine-tune it using PyTorch to generate hair-raising text.

We hope this chapter has proven helpful to you, dear readers. In the next chapter, we will discuss the art of hyperparameters tuning to further improve the performance of our models. See you there!
In the Frankenstein's Monster story, Dr. Frankenstein had chosen GPT-2 for text generation tasks, and Hugging Face had shown him how to fine-tune the model using PyTorch for optimal results. Here is a breakdown of the code used to resolve the story:

``` python
# Importing Libraries
import torch
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

# Fine Tuning
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

train_dataset = ... # Prepare your training dataset

optim = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

epochs = 6
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in train_dataset:
        optim.zero_grad()

        inputs, labels = batch

        inputs = inputs.to('cuda')
        labels = labels.to('cuda')

        loss, logits = model(inputs, labels=labels)
        loss.backward()

        optim.step()
```

The first step is to import the necessary libraries, including the torch library and the transformer library, which allows us to work with pre-trained transformer models such as GPT-2.

``` python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
```

Next, we initialize the tokenizer and model with the `from_pretrained` method from the GPT2Tokenizer and GPT2LMHeadModel classes, respectively. This downloads the pre-trained model and tokenizer specified in the argument from Hugging Face's Model Hub.

``` python
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
```

We then specify and prepare the training dataset according to the task at hand.

``` python
train_dataset = ... # Prepare your training dataset
```

Next, we initialize the optimizer we want to use, in this case, Adam, with a learning rate of 1e-5. 

``` python
optim = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)
```

We specify the number of epochs to train on our model and use nested for-loops to both loop over `epochs` and loop over each batch in the `train_dataset`. 

``` python
epochs = 6
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in train_dataset:
        ...
```

We then define the forward pass by clearing out the gradients (`optim.zero_grad()`), feeding the inputs through the GPT-2 model with the `model(inputs, labels=labels)` statement, and computing the loss. We perform a backward pass and update our model's parameters using the `optim.step()` method.

``` python
optim.zero_grad()

inputs, labels = batch

inputs = inputs.to('cuda')
labels = labels.to('cuda')

loss, logits = model(inputs, labels=labels)
loss.backward()

optim.step()
```

By fine-tuning our model in this way, we can generate text that is expressive and has the desired spooky tone.
