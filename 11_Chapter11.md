# Chapter 11: Dealing with Class Imbalance and Rare Tokens

In the previous chapter, we delved into optimizing loss functions to improve the performance of our large language models in PyTorch. However, we may come across datasets where certain classes or tokens occur very rarely, making it difficult for our models to learn them. This is known as class imbalance and rare token issues, and they can negatively impact the accuracy of our models.

For instance, in natural language processing tasks, there might be certain rare words or phrases in the training dataset, and our model may not have sufficient information to learn about them, resulting in lower performance on those instances. Similarly, in classification problems, there may exist certain classes that occur very infrequently or have a small number of instances, leading to biased predictions and suboptimal accuracy.

In this chapter, we will explore methods to tackle class imbalance and rare token problems in PyTorch. We will discuss how to preprocess the data to handle imbalance, augment data to generate more instances for rare classes or tokens, and adjust the loss function to give more weight to underrepresented classes.

We will provide PyTorch implementation of various methods to deal with class imbalance and rare tokens. We will also refer to recent research articles to provide more in-depth knowledge about the problem and the possible solutions.

So, saddle up your horses and get ready to ride with King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table as we explore ways to conquer these challenges of class imbalance and rare tokens in PyTorch!
# King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table: Dealing with Class Imbalance and Rare Tokens

After the successful defense of the kingdom against the giant's attack, King Arthur and his knights were back at the castle. As they were reminiscing about their victory, the King received a message from the neighboring kingdom asking for their help.

The neighboring kingdom had collected data from their population to develop a language model to help with their administrative tasks. However, they were facing a problem of class imbalance and rare tokens. The model was unable to accurately classify certain classes and tokens due to lack of representation in the dataset.

The King knew that he had the best knights in the kingdom who were skilled at using PyTorch to build powerful language models. So he summoned his trusted knights to help their neighbors.

Sir Lancelot suggested preprocessing the dataset to handle the rarity of certain classes and tokens. He explained how they could upsample the rare classes or tokens to ensure that they have equal representation in the datasets. Sir Percival suggested that they could also augment the data to generate additional instances for certain rare tokens or classes.

However, even after applying these techniques to the language model, they still observed a drop in performance when dealing with underrepresented classes and rare tokens. Sir Galahad suggested modifying the model's loss function to give more weight to these underrepresented classes or tokens.

Following Sir Galahad's suggestion, they modified the loss function to give higher weight to underrepresented classes or tokens. They trained the model again with this adjusted loss function and saw significant improvements in classification accuracy for all classes and tokens, including the rare ones.

The neighboring kingdom was very impressed with the work of King Arthur and his knights. They expressed their gratitude and rewarded them with gold and silver.

King Arthur and his knights rode back to their castle, feeling proud of their work. They held their chins high, knowing that they had made a difference by helping their neighbors and solving the problem of class imbalance and rare tokens in PyTorch.

### The End.
To resolve the issue of class imbalance and rare tokens, the knights used various techniques and modified the loss function to improve the performance of their language model. 

**Preprocessing the dataset:**

To handle the rarity of certain classes and tokens, Sir Lancelot suggested preprocessing the dataset by upsampling rare classes or tokens to ensure that they have equal representation in the datasets. This technique is known as oversampling. 

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler

# Creating the oversampler
oversampler = RandomOverSampler()

# Resampling the dataset
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = oversampler.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

Here, `X_train` and `y_train` are the training data and labels, respectively. The `RandomOverSampler` class from the `imblearn` library is used to upsample the minority classes or tokens. The `fit_resample` method takes in the training data and labels, resamples them to create synthetic data for the minority classes, and returns the new data and labels.

**Augmenting data:**

Sir Percival suggested that they could augment the data to generate additional instances for certain rare tokens or classes. Data augmentation techniques such as text augmentation are used to add more samples with variations of the original text data.

```python
!pip install nlpaug
import nlpaug.augmenter.word as naw

# Creating the augmenter object
augmenter = naw.ContextualWordEmbsAug(model_path='bert-base-uncased', action="insert")

# Augmenting the dataset
X_train_aug = [augmenter.augment(x) for x in X_train if x in rare_tokens]
```

Here, `X_train` is the training data, and `rare_tokens` is a list of tokens considered to be rare in the dataset. The `ContextualWordEmbsAug` class from the `nlpaug` library is used to augment the rare tokens in the dataset. This augmentation technique uses contextual embeddings to generate meaningful and semantically similar variations of the input data.

**Modifying the loss function:**

Sir Galahad suggested modifying the model's loss function to give more weight to these underrepresented classes or tokens. This technique is known as class weighting, where the loss function is modified to assign higher weights to underrepresented classes or tokens.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

# Defining the custom loss function with class weights
class_weights = [1.0] * num_classes  # assuming initially equal weights
class_weights[rare_token_index] = 2.0  # assigning higher weight to rare token
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=torch.tensor(class_weights))
```

Here, `num_classes` is the total number of classes in the dataset, and `rare_token_index` is the index of the rare token. The `CrossEntropyLoss` class from PyTorch is used to define the loss function. The weights of all classes are initially set to 1, and then the weight of the rare token is set to a higher value (e.g., 2) to ensure that it contributes more to the loss calculation.

By using these techniques and modifying the loss function, King Arthur and his knights were able to improve the performance of their language model for class imbalance and rare token issues.
