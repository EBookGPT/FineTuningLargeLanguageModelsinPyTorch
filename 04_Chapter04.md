# Chapter 4: Fine Tuning vs. Training from Scratch

Welcome back to our journey in Fine Tuning Large Language Models in PyTorch! In the previous chapter, we explored the importance of preprocessing data for large language models. Today, we will delve into an interesting debate about whether to fine-tune a pre-trained language model or train from scratch. 

Our special guest for this chapter is the one and only Andrej Karpathy, director of AI at Tesla and a renowned researcher in the field of deep learning. In his now-famous 2015 blog post "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks," Andrej showed how a simple neural network can generate impressive text. Since then, he has been pushing the boundaries of language models, and his work has had a significant impact on natural language processing research.

In this chapter, we will first discuss the pros and cons of fine-tuning a pre-trained language model versus training from scratch. We will then dive into the PyTorch implementation of both processes and compare their performance using a language modeling task.

So grab your swords, mount your horses, and let's get started on this fine-tuning quest!

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Let's load a pre-trained GPT2 model
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Fine Tuning Code
# ...
# Training from Scratch Code

``` 

Are you ready to learn more about fine-tuning and training from scratch? Let the quest begin!
# Chapter 4: Fine Tuning vs. Training from Scratch

Once upon a time, in the court of King Arthur, the knights of the round table were debating the best method to build powerful language models. Sir Lancelot argued that training a model from scratch would lead to a better understanding of the task at hand. Sir Galahad, on the other hand, argued that fine-tuning a pre-trained model would lead to better accuracy and faster convergence. The rest of the knights were caught in the middle, unsure which path to take on this quest.

King Arthur decided to call on the help of a wise wizard who knew the ways of PyTorch, Merlin the Magnificent. Merlin suggested that they consult with Andrej Karpathy, a powerful sorcerer who possessed great knowledge on the art of language modeling.

Andrej arrived at the court of King Arthur and listened patiently to the knights' arguments. After some thought, Andrej said, "It depends on the task at hand, my lords. If you have a large and diverse dataset, fine-tuning a pre-trained model would save you a lot of time and would lead to better performance. However, if you have a specialized task or a small dataset, training from scratch is your best bet."

The knights were still unsure, so Andrej decided to show them examples of fine-tuning versus training from scratch using PyTorch. He demonstrated that fine-tuning a pre-trained model like GPT2 on a language modeling task led to higher accuracy in less time compared to training a model from scratch. However, he also showed that training from scratch on a task like summarization, which requires a more specialized approach, led to better results.

The knights were amazed by the results and thanked Andrej for his guidance. They realized that both fine-tuning and training from scratch have their strengths and weaknesses and ultimately depend on the task at hand.

Before Andrej left, he gave them a piece of advice. "Remember, my lords, always compare the performance of both methods on your specific task before deciding which path to take."

The knights agreed and thanked Andrej for shedding light on this debate. They continued their fine-tuning quest, armed with the knowledge of the best way to build powerful language models.

```python
# Fine Tuning Example with GPT2
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Add task-specific padding tokens
tokenizer.add_tokens(['[TASK_START]', '[TASK_END]'])

# Load task-specific dataset
task_dataset = MyTaskDataset()

# Fine-tuning configuration
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          
    evaluation_strategy = IntervalStrategy.STEPS,
    eval_steps = 500,             
    save_steps = 500,              
    num_train_epochs = 5,              
    learning_rate = 5e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size = 8,  
    per_device_eval_batch_size = 8,   
    warmup_steps = 500,              
    weight_decay = 0.01,            
    logging_dir='./logs',            
)

# Define Trainer object
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=task_dataset,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

# Fine-tuning starts here...
trainer.train()

# Training from Scratch Example with a Custom Model
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.embeddings = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, 128)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(128, 128, num_layers=2, batch_first=True)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(128, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, input_ids, hidden=None):
        embeddings = self.embeddings(input_ids)
        lstm_output, hidden = self.lstm(embeddings, hidden)
        logits = self.linear(lstm_output)
        return logits, hidden

# Load Task-Specific Dataset
task_dataset = MyTaskDataset()

# Define Training Configuration
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 8

# Define Dataloader
dataloader = DataLoader(task_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)

# Training Loop starts here...
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        input_ids = batch['input_ids']
        target_ids = batch['target_ids']
        logits, hidden = model(input_ids)
        loss = criterion(logits.view(-1, vocab_size), target_ids.view(-1))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

``` 

And so, King Arthur and his knights learned the importance of fine-tuning versus training from scratch in their quest to build powerful language models. They thanked Andrej Karpathy and Merlin the Magnificent for their guidance, and continued on their quest armed with the knowledge and code to build language models that would go down in the annals of history.
Sure, let me explain the code used to resolve the King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table story in Chapter 4 of our Fine-Tuning Large Language Models in PyTorch book.

## Fine-Tuning Example with GPT2

```python
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Add task-specific padding tokens
tokenizer.add_tokens(['[TASK_START]', '[TASK_END]'])

# Load task-specific dataset
task_dataset = MyTaskDataset()

# Fine-tuning configuration
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          
    evaluation_strategy = IntervalStrategy.STEPS,
    eval_steps = 500,             
    save_steps = 500,              
    num_train_epochs = 5,              
    learning_rate = 5e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size = 8,  
    per_device_eval_batch_size = 8,   
    warmup_steps = 500,              
    weight_decay = 0.01,            
    logging_dir='./logs',            
)

# Define Trainer object
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=task_dataset,
    data_collator=default_data_collator,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

# Fine-tuning starts here...
trainer.train()
```

This code shows an example of fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT2 model on a task-specific dataset. To fine-tune a language model, we first load a pre-trained model and tokenizer, in this case the GPT2 model and tokenizer. We then add task-specific padding tokens using the tokenizer.add_tokens() method.

Next, we load the task-specific dataset using PyTorch's Dataset class, and define the fine-tuning configuration using the [TrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#trainingarguments) class. This class defines hyperparameters, like the number of epochs, learning rate, and batch size.

Finally, we define a [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#trainer) object, which takes in the pre-trained model, the training configuration, the task-specific dataset, and the tokenizer. We then call the `trainer.train()` method to start the fine-tuning process.

## Training from Scratch Example with a Custom Model

```python
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.embeddings = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, 128)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(128, 128, num_layers=2, batch_first=True)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(128, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, input_ids, hidden=None):
        embeddings = self.embeddings(input_ids)
        lstm_output, hidden = self.lstm(embeddings, hidden)
        logits = self.linear(lstm_output)
        return logits, hidden

# Load Task-Specific Dataset
task_dataset = MyTaskDataset()

# Define Training Configuration
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 8

# Define Dataloader
dataloader = DataLoader(task_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)

# Training Loop starts here...
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        input_ids = batch['input_ids']
        target_ids = batch['target_ids']
        logits, hidden = model(input_ids)
        loss = criterion(logits.view(-1, vocab_size), target_ids.view(-1))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

This code shows an example of training a custom model from scratch on a task-specific dataset. We define a simple LSTM-based model using PyTorch's [nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html) class. 

We then load the task-specific dataset and define the training configuration, including the optimizer, criterion, number of epochs, and batch size. Finally, we define a dataloader using Pytorch's [DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) class, which loads the dataset in batches.

We then enter the training loop, which iterates over each epoch and batch of the dataset, zeroing the optimizer gradients, calculating and backpropagating the loss, and updating the model parameters.

And that's it! These examples show the difference between fine-tuning a pre-trained language model versus training a custom model from scratch, as well as how to use PyTorch to implement both methods in your language modeling projects.
